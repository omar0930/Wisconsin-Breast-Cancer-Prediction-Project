# Wisconsin-Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Project
This project aims to analyze and build predictive models for the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The primary objective is to classify tumor samples as benign or malignant based on various features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast mass.

Project Overview
The notebook includes the following steps:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Importing necessary libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
Loading the dataset and performing initial data exploration.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing data distributions and correlations.
Identifying and handling missing values.
Understanding the statistical properties of the dataset.
Feature Engineering:

Selecting relevant features for model training.
Scaling and normalizing data as needed.
Model Building:

Applying various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines.
Tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.
Model Evaluation:

Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Creating confusion matrices and ROC curves to evaluate classification results.
Conclusion and Insights:

Summarizing findings and discussing the implications of the results.
Providing recommendations for further research or practical applications.
