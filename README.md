# Wisconsin Breast Cancer Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting breast cancer diagnosis (benign or malignant) using machine learning techniques applied to the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. The goal is to develop an accurate and interpretable model for early detection.

## Features
- **Cancer Diagnosis Prediction**: Uses supervised learning algorithms to classify tumors.
- **Feature Engineering**: Analyzes critical features affecting diagnosis.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides insights through plots and statistical summaries.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset.
- **Features**: Includes cell nucleus characteristics such as radius, texture, perimeter, and smoothness.
- **Target Variable**: Malignant (M) or Benign (B) diagnosis.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/omar0930/Wisconsin-Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Project.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Wisconsin-Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Project
```

## Usage
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Train and evaluate machine learning models.
3. Interpret and visualize the results.


## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Decision Trees
